# Getting Started with My Create React App, which shows product list with sort by name and filter by name . after login with email and password you see a tabbar at the top of page , first one is add /editbox , second one is filter box with name of product.                                                                                         for adding a product , type name and price of it . for editing a product click on edit icon of that specific product , then you see name and price of it it in crud box , then click on edit box



## Available Scripts

# I used json-server and json-server-auth for mpck api , so run  first:

### `npm run server`      --> http://localhost:3000

then for front end     

### `npm  run start`      --->open  http://localhost:3006 to view it in the browser.
**Note: for running is dev mode.**
mac :PORT=3006  react-scripts start
windows : set PORT=3006 &&  react-scripts start

**Note:  for db server I created db.json inside data folder with running jsonGenerator.js file, if you want to create a new one  1. add "type":"module" inside package.json file 2.go to data folder and  run node jsonGenerator.js 3.if you want to use new 'db1.json' before running server , change db1.json---> db.json ,becuase serve is using this one**


### `npm test`
